# Blinkit Sales Dashboard

## 📌 About the Project
I created this Power BI dashboard to help Blinkit track its sales, manage stock, and understand customer buying habits.

The primary objective was to identify useful patterns in sales data and inform more informed business decisions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI (for dashboard)
- Excel (for cleaning data)
- SQL (for analyzing data)

## 🔍 What You’ll See in the Dashboard
- Daily and weekly sales trends
- Which products are selling the most
- Low stock alerts
- Customer behavior (like what they buy often)
- Delivery improvement tracking

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to clean and manage large data
