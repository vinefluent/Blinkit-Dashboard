# Blinkit Sales Dashboard

## 📌 About the Project
I created this Power BI dashboard to help Blinkit track their sales, manage stock, and understand customer buying habits.

The main goal was to find useful patterns in sales data and help make better business decisions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI (for dashboard)
- Excel (for cleaning data)
- SQL (for analyzing data)

## 🔍 What You’ll See in the Dashboard
- Daily and weekly sales trends
- Which products are selling most
- Low stock alerts
- Customer behavior (like what they buy often)
- Delivery improvement tracking
